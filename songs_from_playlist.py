This script takes in a Spotify playlist ID. It then creates and updates playlist.json. Afterwards, it searches each song in 
the playlist and adds the songs to songs.json. It also updates song-artist, song-playlist, and song-album relationships.
Finally, it creates artists_to_check.json and albums_to_check.json, containing a list of IDs that should be added to the database.
